# neog.camp-mark8
Created with CodeSandbox

This project is build with React. The user is presented a set of emojis and clicking on the emoji will display the meaning of the emoji as a text message. 

The emoji icon and its meaning are stored as an object where the key is the emoji and the property is the meaining of the emoji. When the user interacts with a click, the keys in the object are looked up and the corresponding meaning is deisplayed.
